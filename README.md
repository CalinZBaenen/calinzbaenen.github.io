## What is this website?
These HTML pages, images, CSS, etc..., are, collectively, my website; I made this webpage for
fun to show off my work and creativity.  
I started work on the website since I was eleven or twelve, and, throughout the course of its history,
it has seen a lot of revisions since its initial launch.

(Website version: `1.1.1`)
