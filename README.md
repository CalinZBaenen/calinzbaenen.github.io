## What is this website?

These HTML pages, images, CSS, etc..., are, collectively, my website; I made this webpage to show off my work and creativity.  
I started work on the website since I was eleven or twelve, and, throughout the course of its history, it has seen a lot of revisions since its initial launch on Google Firebase.

(Website version: `1.2.1`)


## Who am I?

I am Calin Baenen, a pansexual, nonbinary programmer that was born October 30th, 2006.  
I have programming experience in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript), and [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)).  
    (My favorite of which is Rust.)


## Hobbies and Interests

I enjoy programming, writing, and dissecting grammar; currently, I am practicing Swedish.  
I rarely play games nowadays; however, when I find a good game I can get really into it, like [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) or [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/).
