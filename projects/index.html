				<h2>Functional Stuff</h2>
				<p>
					This is a list of projects I have made that are functional, i.e. do
					something/serve some purpose:

					<!-- ParseJS. -->
					<dt class="dict-entry"><a href="https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/ParseJS">ParseJS</a></dt><a class="txt-sup" href="/projects/parsejs">(see more)</a>
					<dd>
						<i>ParseJS</i> is a tokenization library for JavaScript I made when I was in ninth grade.<br/>
						I came up with the idea when I was trying to come up for a way to store tabular data in
						a textual format that was character-efficient, but in the process of writing it
						I decided I wanted a lexer to find tokens for me, and this was the result.
					</dd>
					
					
					
					<!-- HotTea. -->
					<dt><a href="https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/HotTea">HotTea</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<i>HotTea</i> is a library I made to allow people to imitate
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing">static-typing</a>
						in JavaScript; more accurately, it aimed to add "typed objects",
						which were objects that threw errors if you tried to set or retrieve
						keys that weren't in a predefined list called the "blueprint".
					</dd>
					
					
					
					<!-- Flexable Object Oriented Language. -->
					<dt><a href="https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/NonBinariesNB_FlexableObjectOrientedLanguage"><abbr>FOOL</abbr> (Flexable Object Oriented Language)</a></dt>
					<dd>
						<i>Flexable Object Oriented Language</i> (<i>FOOL</i>) was my (first) attempt at writing my
						own programming language.<br/>
						The language was written in Python when I was twelve and was published
						<time datetime="2019-08-19">August 9th, 2019</time>. The spelling mistake in
						the name was due to my young age; I was unsure of the ending of "flexible" and
						just thought the word ended in <i>-able</i>, like a lot of other English words do.

						<i>E3D</i> was a pseudo-3D graphics drawing program made in HTML and JavaScript;
						the project was published when I was thirteenish.
