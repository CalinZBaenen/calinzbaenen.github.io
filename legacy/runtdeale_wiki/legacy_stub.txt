The RuntDeale "wiki" page I made dates back to my time in high elementary-school, low middle-school; I originally made the wiki when I was in sixth or seventh grade.
This webpage was even hosted on Google Firebase for a while. Eventually, though, it fell out of use and into the depths of my Google Drive storage.

Some modifications have been made to the page to reduce file-size and enhance readability; otherwise, this is the site as it originally was.
