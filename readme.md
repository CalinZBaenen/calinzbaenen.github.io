## Who am I?
Hello, I'm Calin Baenen, a pansexual, enby, programmer born on October 30th, 2006.  
I enjoy playing games, helping people, and programming as my hobby and hope to make it my career.

I work in programming languages such as [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language), [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), and others!  
  (My favorite is Rust.)
