				<h2>Furries Think They Are Animals</h2>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Myth</th>
						<td>It is commonly believed that furries think they are animals trapped in a human body.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Description</th>
						<td>
							Due to poor analogy with terms such as "identifying as" or "wanting to be",
							people opt to thinking that furries are people that want to be animals.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Truth</th>
						<td>
							This misconception is false, but has some seed of truth.<br/>
							Lots of furries represent themselves using humanoid animals called "fursonas".
							A fursona is a persona that is an anthropomorphic animal, hence the naming.
						</td>

				<h2>You Need A Fursuit To Be A Furry</h2>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Myth</th>
						<td>It is commonly believed that you need a fursuit to be part of the furry community.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Description</th>
						<td>
							In part due to the previous myth, and because of the fact that a noticable
							minority of furries do wear fursuits, people think that they need a fursuit
							to be a furry.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Truth</th>
						<td>
							Furries are just people who have an interest in anthropomorphic animals; anyone can be a part of the
							furry fandom, even if they don't own any gear.
						</td>

				<h2>Fursuiters Act Like The Animals They Dress As</h2>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Myth</th>
						<td>It is commonly believed that people who wear fursuits act like the animal they dress as.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Description</th>
						<td>
							Because people think furries believe they are animals, or because people think furries want to be animals,
							and because some people in the furry community do act like the animals they choose to be, people think that
							all fursuiters act like the animal they dress as.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Truth</th>
						<td>
							People will sometimes roleplay as the animal their fursona is, but this fact does not hold true for everyone;<br/>
							If someone says they do not act like that, just let it be and do not harass them about it.
						</td>

			<section id="being-a-furry-is-purely-sexual">
				<h2>Being A Furry Is Purely Sexual</h2>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Myth</th>
						<td>It is commonly believed that being a furry is a purely sexual or that being a furry is a fetish.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Description</th>
						<td>
							Due to the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) side of the community, and how noticable they are,
							people associate the fandom with this particular group of people; however, like any other
							fandom, there will, of course, be a NSFW side.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Truth</th>
						<td>
							Saying everyone in the furry community is in it for the sexual aspect is a gross overgeneralization.
							For example, consider swimsuits &mdash; they are not inherently sexual, but they are frequently sexualized.<br/>
							Being a furry is not a fetish, nor is there much evidence of that.

				<h2>Furries Have Problems</h2>
				
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Myth</th>
						<td>It is commonly believed that furries have mental disorders or personality disorders; this is untrue.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Description</th>
						<td>
							Because of confirmation bias, existing biggotry, and real instances
							of the stereotype, people believe all furries have something wrong with them,
							assuming that is "why they are their own special group".
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th aria-level="3" scope="row">Truth</th>
						<td>Data has shown that a lot of furries are just normal people.</td>
