				<h2>Why do people become furries?</h2>
				<p>
					People may consider themselves furries for a variety of reasons; it's important to note that not
					everyone's motivations or experiences are the same.
				</p>
				
				<p>Here are some reasons why a person may consider themselves a furry:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Identification &mdash; identifying with an anthropomorphic animal character
						may allow one to explore/express aspects of their personality, creativity,
						or imagination that they might not feel comfortable expressing in their everyday lives.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Social comfort &mdash; for some furries, especially in cases where the furry is
						<a hreflang="en" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23154-neurodivergent">neurodivergent</a>,
						being a furry ensures they are in a clique, and they won't need to worry as much about scrutiny from others.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Creativity &mdash; some people may be (drawn to) furries because of art;
						anthropomorphic animal characters come up a lot in cartoons, and the choice of animal can make for
						fun characters designs, character traits, etc...
					</li>
				</ol>

			<section id="can-furries-be-any-animal">
				<h2>Can furries be any animal?</h2>
				<p>
					Yes.<br/>
					Furries can choose any animal that they please if they feel like it represents them.

			<!-- Is someone still a furry, even if their fursona's animal has no fur? -->
			<section id="if-someones-fursona-is-a-reptile-or-other-hairless-creature-are-they-still-a-furry">
				<h2>If someone's fursona is a reptile, or other hairless creature, are they still a furry?</h2>
				<p>
					Yes.<br/>
					People whose fursonas which are animals without hair are still considered furries, and,
					in the case of reptiles and amphibians, are considered a subset of furries,
					which are called "scalies".
				</p>

			<section id="how-do-furries-choose-what-animal-they-are">
				<h2>How do furries choose what animal they are?</h2>
				<p>
					It is complicated; there is no straightforward answer to why someone chooses their
					fursona's animal.<br/>
					Some factors could include personal experiences with their animal, whether or not that
					animal is their "spirit animal", and the historical significance of the character
					that acts as their fursona<b>*</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*</b> &mdash; In my case, I created
					<a href="/resources/furries/my_fursona">Katty</a> before I considered myself
					a furry; however, after the character grew on me, I decided that I
					resonated with them a lot, and I decided to label them as my fursona.
