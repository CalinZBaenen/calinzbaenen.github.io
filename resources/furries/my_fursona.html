				<h2>Who is my fursona?</h2>
				<p>
					My fursona is named "Katty". They are are a gray tabby cat with emerald
					green eyes and a light gray muzzle. In fact, you've been
					looking at Katty this whole time while navigating my website;
					he's the little icon in the upper-left of each page.<br/>
					Their full &ldquo;title&rdquo;, so to speak, is "Katty the Gray Tabby Cat".
				</p>

			<section id="the-history-of-katty">
				<h2>The History of Katty</h2>
				<p>
					Katty wasn't originally my fursona, nor was that the intent.<br/>
					Originally when I was creating Katty, I was designing them to
					be a video-game character.<br/>
					The game in question would have been called "Kitty Katty" and based off of
					a game called "Banjo Kazooie".
					"Banjo" and "Kazooie" were the names of the two main characters in the game,
					hence the weird naming in my inspired game's title, I even designed a similar
					looking logo.
				</p>
				<div data-flexDir="row" class="image-raster flex">
					<img data-shape="landscape" data-size="l" type="image/png" alt="[Banjo Kazooie logo.]"
						src="/assets/images/misc/banjokazooie_logo.png"/>
					<img data-shape="landscape" data-size="l" type="image/png" alt="[Kitty Katty logo.]"
						src="/assets/images/misc/kittykatty_logo.png"/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Originally when I had plans for the game, I had no idea what this fuzzy
					feline would look like, so I just kind of threw some discriptors together.

				<h2>The Design of Katty</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
						The first image of Katty to exist was just a head.<br/>
						This design was created by <i>&lt;redacted&gt;</i> as a gift and shared
						with me on September 17th, 2019; this is the original image:
					</p>
					<img data-size="s" type="image/png" alt="[Kitty & Katty.]" src="/assets/images/Katty/kitty_and_katty.png"/>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Two years and something months later, I had a Amirah Mounger, a peer
						of mine, commission a new drawing of Katty.<br/>
						It was commissioned on May 10th, 2022 and given to me on May 12th, 2022.
					</p>
					<div class="image-raster fluid">
						<img data-shape="portrait" data-size="s" type="image/png" alt="[Image of Katty facing forward.]"
							src="/assets/images/Katty/fursona_front.png"/>
						<img data-shape="portrait" data-size="s" type="image/png" alt="[Image of Katty facing backward.]"
							src="/assets/images/Katty/fursona_back.png"/>
					</div>
					<p>
						I also have a Minecraft skin I made, which was later touched-up
						by <i>&lt;redacted&gt;</i>, that reflects my fursona and the account name
						(which I happened to name <code>Katty_KittyKatty</code>).
