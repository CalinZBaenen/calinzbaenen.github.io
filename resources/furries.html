					<h2>What or who is a "furry"?</h2>
					<p>
						Furries are groups of people interested in anthropomorphic animals.
						They can range from really furry like a bunny to scaley like a lizard.<br/>
						This group of people is called the furry fandom.<br/>
						<br/>
						<a class="nocolor-url" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=furry+definition&safe=active">
							From Oxford English Dictionary
						</a>: "an enthusiast for animal characters with human characteristics, in particular a person who dresses up in costume as such a character or uses one as an avatar online.".

					<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
					<p>
						There is a variety of misconceptions about furries.<br/>
						This table below is a list of some of the most common ones:

							<td>Furries are people who think they're animals.</td>
							<td>
								Due to poor analogy with terms such as "identifying as"
								or "wanting to be" people opt to thinking that furries
								are people that want to be animals.
							</td>
							<td>
								This misconception is false, but has some seed of truth.<br/>
								Lots of furries represent themselves using humanoid animals
								called "fursonas".<br/>
								A fursona is a persona that is the animal version of their
								persona, hence the naming.

							<td>You need a fursuit to be a furry.</td>
							<td>
								In part with the previous myth and the fact that a noticable
								minority of furries are actually wear fursuits, people think
								that they need a fursuit to be a furry.
							</td>
							<td>
								This rumor is false.<br/>
								As chiefly mentioned, furries are just people who have
								an interest in anthropomorphic animals.<br/>
								Anyone can be a part of the furry fandom even if they don't own
								any gear.

							<td>
								Being a Furry is purely sexual.<br/>
								<br/>
								Being a furry is a fetish.
							</td>
							<td>
								Due to the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) side of the community
								and how noticable they are, people associate the fandom
								with this particular group of people.<br/>
								But, like any other fandom, of course there will be a NSFW side.
								Other communities, for example the Disney fandom, a lot of
								people sexualize certain Disney movies according
								to their tastes. - Does this mean everyone who likes Disney
								thinks this way?<br/>
								No. Of course not.
							</td>
							<td>
								As the sentence at the end of the paragraph in the last
								cell tried to prove, this is an overgeneralization.<br/>
								People think that being a furry is a fetish, but it isn't,
								nor have there been any studies to prove it.<br/>
								Most people in the LGBTQIA have sex, does that mean asexuals,
								as part of that same group have sex?<br/>
								No. - But that would be pure irony.

					<h2>Are furries connected to the LGTBQIA+ community?</h2>
					<p>
						While there is overlap between the furry fandom and the LGTBQIA+
						they are not directly connected.<br/>
						Someone can be a furry without being in the LGBTQIA+ community, and vice-versa.
						And sometimes people are in both groups, such as me, a pansexual, non-binary furry.
