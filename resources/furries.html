				<h2>What or who is a "furry"?</h2>
				<p>
					Furries are groups of people interested in anthropomorphic animals.
					They can range from really furry like a bunny to scaley like a lizard.<br/>
					This group of people is called the furry fandom.<br/>
					<br/>
					<a class="nocolor-url" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=furry+definition&safe=active">
						From Oxford English Dictionary
					</a>: "An enthusiast for animal characters with human characteristics, in particular a person who dresses up in costume as such a character or uses one as an avatar online.".

				<h2>Misconceptions</h2>

					There is a variety of misconceptions about furries.<br/>
					This table below is a list of some of the most common ones:

					<tr>
						<td>Furries are people who think they're animals.</td>
						<td>
							Due to poor analogy with terms such as "identifying as"
							or "wanting to be" people opt to thinking that furries
							are people that want to be animals.
						</td>
						<td>
							This misconception is false, but has some seed of truth.<br/>
							Lots of furries represent themselves using humanoid animals
							called "fursonas".<br/>
							A fursona is a persona that is the animal version of their
							persona, hence the naming.

					<tr>
						<td>You need a fursuit to be a furry.</td>
						<td>
							In part with the previous myth and the fact that a noticable
							minority of furries are actually wear fursuits, people think
							that they need a fursuit to be a furry.
						</td>
						<td>
							This rumor is false.<br/>
							As chiefly mentioned, furries are just people who have
							an interest in anthropomorphic animals.<br/>
							Anyone can be a part of the furry fandom even if they don't own
							any gear.

					<tr>
						<td>
							Being a Furry is purely sexual.<br/>
							<br/>
							Being a furry is a fetish.
						</td>
						<td>
							Due to the NSFW (Not Safe For Work) side of the community
							and how noticable they are, people associate the fandom
							with this particular group of people.<br/>
							But, like any other fandom, of course there will be a NSFW side.
							Other communities, for example the Disney fandom, a lot of
							people sexualize certain Disney movies according
							to their tastes. - Does this mean everyone who likes Disney
							thinks this way?<br/>
							No. Of course not.
						</td>
						<td>
							As the sentence at the end of the paragraph in the last
							cell tried to prove, this is an overgeneralization.<br/>
							People think that being a furry is a fetish, but it isn't,
							nor have there been any studies to prove it.<br/>
							Most people in the LGBTQIA have sex, does that mean asexuals,
							as part of that same group have sex?<br/>
							No. - But that would be pure irony.

				<h2>Are furries connected to the LGTBQIA+ community?</h2>
				<p>
					While there is overlap between the furry fandom and the LGTBQIA+
					they are not directly connected.<br/>
					Someone can be a furry without being in the LGBTQIA+ community, and vice-versa.
					And sometimes people are in both groups, such as me, a pansexual, non-binary furry.
