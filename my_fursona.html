					<h2>Who is my fursona?</h2>
					<p>
						My fursona is named "Katty". They are are a gray tabby cat with emerald
						green eyes and a light gray muzzle.<br/>
						In fact, you've been looking at Katty this whole time navigating my website,
						he's the little icon in the upper-left of each page.<br/>
						<br/>
						Their full official &ldquo;title&rdquo; so to speak, is "Katty the Gray Tabby Cat".
					</p>
				</div>

					<h2>The history of Katty.</h2>
					<p>
						Katty wasn't originally my fursona, nor was that the intent.<br/>
						Originally when I was creating Katty, I was designing them to
						be a video-game character.<br/>
						The game in question would have been called "Kitty Katty" and based off of
						a game called "Banjo Kazooie".
						"Banjo" and "Kazooie" were the names of the two main characters in the game,
						hence the weird naming in my inspired game's title, I even designed a similar
						looking logo.
						<div style="display:flex;">
							<img class="hrect-simg no-select" type="image/png"
								alt="Banjo Kazooie logo." src="./bklogo.png"/>
							<img class="hrect-simg no-select" style="margin-left:2vw;"
								type="image/png" alt="Kitty Katty logo." src="./kklogo.png"/>
						</div>
						Originally when I had plans for the game, I had no idea what this fuzzy
						feline would look like, so I just kind of threw some discriptors together.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>The design of Katty.</h2>
					<p>
						The first image of Katty to exist was just a head.<br/>
						This design was created by <i>&lt;redacted&gt;</i> as a gift and shared
						with my on September 17th, 2019.<br/>
						The image below is the original image.<br/>
						<img class="srect-simg no-select"
							type="image/png" alt="Katty & Kitty.png"
							src="./kitty_and_katty.png"/><br/>
						<br/>
						Two years and something months later, I had a Amirah Mounger, a peer
						of mine, commission a drawing of Katty.<br/>
						It was commissioned on May 10th, 2022 and given to me on
						May 12th, 2022.<br/>
						<div style="display:flex;">
							<img class="vrect-simg no-select" type="image/png"
								alt="Image of Katty facing forward."
								src="./katty_front.png"/>
							<img class="vrect-simg no-select" style="margin-left:2vw;"
								type="image/png" alt="Image of Katty facing backward."
								src="./katty_back.png"/>
						</div>
						I also have a Minecraft skin I made and was later touched-up
						by <i>&lt;redacted&gt;</i> that reflects my fursona and the account name
						(which I happened to name <code>Katty_KittyKatty</code>).<br/>
